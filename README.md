# md5unicode.js
A unicode-compatible MD5 implementation in Javascript.
This work is a compilation from various other implementations. 

If you find a bug in this implementation, please feel free to:
- File an issue, specifying the plaintext value that produced an incorrect result.
- Open a PR, including a test-case for that erroneous plaintext, and a fix if one is available.

**This repository is not actively maintained.** 
Years ago, I worked extensively in front-end Javascript, and needed libraries like this.
My work has changed substantially, so at this point, the only time I get with Javascript is for hobbies.

In any case, I hope this code is useful to you anyway. :)
